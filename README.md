## Usage

### Selecting a TTS Engine

TTS-Story supports eight TTS engine options. In the **Settings** tab, choose your preferred default engine:

| Engine | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Kokoro · Local GPU** | Run Kokoro-82M locally | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA |
| **Kokoro · Replicate** | Kokoro via cloud API | Replicate API token |
| **Chatterbox · Local GPU** | Chatterbox with voice cloning | NVIDIA GPU (~8GB VRAM) |
| **Chatterbox · Replicate** | Chatterbox via cloud API | Replicate API token |
| **VoxCPM 1.5 · Local GPU** | VoxCPM with voice cloning & auto-transcription | NVIDIA GPU (~6GB VRAM) |
| **Qwen3 TTS · Custom Voice** | Qwen3 TTS custom voice prompts | NVIDIA GPU (local) |
| **Qwen3 TTS · Clone** | Qwen3 TTS voice cloning from reference audio | NVIDIA GPU (local) |
| **Qwen3 TTS · Voice Creation** | Qwen3 TTS voice design (new voice creation) | NVIDIA GPU (local) |

You can also override the engine per-job in the **Generate** tab.

### VoxCPM 1.5 Engine

VoxCPM 1.5 is a powerful voice cloning engine with unique features:

- **Automatic Transcription**: If no transcript is provided, VoxCPM uses SenseVoice ASR to automatically transcribe the reference audio
- **Shared Voice Prompts**: Uses the same voice prompt library as Chatterbox
- **Lower VRAM Requirements**: Runs on GPUs with ~6GB VRAM
- **High Quality Output**: Produces natural-sounding speech with good prosody

### Basic Workflow

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
2. In **Settings**, select your preferred TTS engine
3. If using Replicate engines, enter your API token in the **Replicate API** section
4. Paste your text with or without speaker tags in the **Generate** tab
5. Select a **Default Voice** (used for plain text / unassigned speakers)
6. If you use speaker tags, TTS-Story automatically analyzes the text and lets you assign voices per speaker
7. Click **Generate Audio**
8. The job is added to the **Job Queue**, processed in the background, and the result appears in:
   - **Job Queue** tab (with real-time progress, ETA, and player)
   - **Library** tab (all past generations with engine indicator)

### Using Voice Cloning (Chatterbox & VoxCPM)

When using Chatterbox or VoxCPM engines:

1. First, add voice recordings in **Available Voices → Voice Prompts**
2. In the **Generate** tab, select your cloned voice from the **Reference Prompt** dropdown
3. Use the gender and language filters to quickly find the right voice
4. Each speaker can use a different cloned voice for multi-character stories

### Quick Test Previews

- A shared "Quick Test Text" field lives above the Assigned Voices section so you can type once and preview any speaker with matching FX.
- Each speaker row includes an inline Quick Test button beside the tone controls.

**Note:** Local GPU modes run entirely on your machine and never use cloud APIs, ensuring complete privacy and no API costs.

### Silence & Timing Controls

- **Intro Silence (ms):** Adds empty space before the very first spoken line
- **Silence Between Segments (ms):** Inserts a gap after each chunk/line before the next one begins
- Both settings are configurable in the **Generation Settings** panel (0–2000 ms, 100 ms steps)

### Replicate API Setup

Both Kokoro · Replicate and Chatterbox · Replicate use the same API token:

1. Get your API key from [Replicate](https://replicate.com) (starts with `r8_...`)
2. In **Settings**, enter your token in the **Replicate API** section
3. Click **Save Settings**
4. Select either Replicate engine from the dropdown

### Speaker Tag Format

You can use either numbered speakers or named speakers:

**Numbered Format:**
```
[speaker1]Hello, my name is Alice.[/speaker1]
[speaker2]Nice to meet you, Alice! I'm Bob.[/speaker2]
[speaker1]It's great to meet you too![/speaker1]
```

**Named Format:**
```
[narrator]Once upon a time, in a land far away...[/narrator]
[alice]Hello, my name is Alice.[/alice]
[bob]Nice to meet you, Alice! I'm Bob.[/bob]
[narrator]And so their adventure began.[/narrator]
```

You can use any alphanumeric name (letters, numbers, underscores). The system will automatically detect all unique speakers and let you assign voices to each one.

### Gemini Pre-Processing Workflow

Need to tidy a manuscript or add consistent speaker tags before running TTS? Use the **Prep Text with Gemini** button:

1. Enter your Gemini API key and model in **Settings**, then click **Fetch Available Models** if you want to load the latest list directly from Google.
2. Paste your story in the **Generate** tab and decide whether "Generate separate audio files for each chapter" should be enabled.
3. Select a **Prompt Preset** (see below) or write your own custom prompt.
4. Click **Prep Text with Gemini**:
   - If chapter splitting is enabled, TTS-Story reuses the detected chapter list and sends each one to Gemini separately with your pre-prompt and the running speaker list.
   - If chapter splitting is disabled, the whole manuscript (plus pre-prompt) is sent in a single Gemini request to respect the context window.
   - A real-time progress bar shows which chapter or full-text step is running.
5. When Gemini finishes, the cleaned/expanded narrative replaces the input field. Chapter headings stay inside the narrator tags so audio splitting still works.
6. Re-run **Analyze Text** if needed. Your voice assignments and FX settings remain untouched unless you explicitly reset them.

Because the speaker list is tracked across sections, characters that appear later continue to use the same tag, which keeps the voice assignment UI tidy and prevents duplicate dropdowns.

#### Pre-loaded Prompt Presets

TTS-Story includes three pre-configured Gemini prompt presets optimized for different use cases:

| Preset | Best For | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Chatterbox Natural Dialogue Conversation** | Chatterbox engines | Transforms text into natural-sounding dialogue with paralinguistic tags (laughter, sighs, pauses) and human speech quirks. Ideal for conversational content where you want expressive, lifelike output. |
| **Chatterbox Audio Book Conversion** | Chatterbox engines | Maintains strict adherence to the original text while converting symbols and abbreviations that TTS engines struggle with into speakable words (e.g., "/" → "slash", "-" → "dash", "Dr." → "Doctor"). |
| **Kokoro Audio Book Conversion** | Kokoro engines | Preserves the exact text of the book while adding speaker tags and preparing the content for TTS conversion. Focuses on accurate speaker identification and proper text segmentation without modifying the original prose. |

Select a preset from the dropdown in the Gemini section, or create your own custom prompts and save them for reuse.

### Plain Text Mode

If no speaker tags are found, the entire text will be processed with a single voice.

### Job Queue & Library

- **Job Queue** tab shows all jobs with:
  - Real-time progress bars and chunk counts
  - ETA estimates during processing
  - Status indicators (`queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
  - Per-job controls (cancel, download)
- **Library** tab lists all completed outputs (sorted newest first) with:
  - **Engine indicator** showing which TTS engine was used (Kokoro, Kokoro Replicate, Chatterbox, Chatterbox Replicate)
  - Inline audio players
  - Download links
  - Delete and "Clear All" controls

### Available Voices & Previews

- **Available Voices** tab lists all Kokoro-82M voices grouped by language.
- You can:
  - Generate preview samples for all voices
  - Regenerate (overwrite) samples if you change text or update voices
  - Click any voice to play its preview sample

### Custom Voice Blends

- Open the **Custom Voice Blends** panel inside the **Available Voices** tab to create bespoke voices.
- Click **New Custom Voice** (or Edit on any card) to open the modal where you can:
  - Name the blend and choose its language group (lang_code)
  - Add one or more component voices and set their mix weights (e.g., 0.5 narrator + 0.5 af_heart)
  - Optionally add notes for future reference
- Saved blends appear in the grid with metadata (code, language, updated time) and can be edited or deleted at any time.
- All custom voices automatically show up in:
  - Default voice dropdowns
  - Per-speaker assignment selects (grouped by language under “Custom Blends” optgroups)
  - `/api/voices` responses (`custom_voices` arrays per language) so automation scripts can use them.
- When the generator encounters a `custom_*` voice, the backend blends the component embeddings on the fly and caches the tensor for fast reuse.

> Tip: The API exposes the full CRUD workflow under `/api/custom-voices`, so you can script voice creation or keep predefined blends in source control.
